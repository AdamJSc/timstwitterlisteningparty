"Stuart Bailie","Trouble Songs","Former NME editor eloquently tracks the history of music and conflict in Northern Ireland. From the profound impact of Van's Astral Weeks and the chaos of The Clash's 1977 visit to the rise of The Undertones and the triumph of Ash and Therapy?

"Chris Heath", "Literally & Vs America", "In 1989 and 1991 Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe allowed Chris Heath to be an ambient presence as they embarked on their first tours.
